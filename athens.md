## Specification for Athens TOKEN



## ERC20
* total supply 10 million or less.
* 50% minted at launch and stored in treasury.

* out of those 5 million that are minted, 2.5 million are then distributed to community members (decide a distribution mechanism - write an whitelist airdrop function )
* 2.5 million are then given to investors depending on negotiations to investors.


## goals
* incentivise and reward people
* govern and control the DAOs


## Governance in AthensDAO
* What are the governance proposals that the ATH can drive?
    - vote for removing committee members in a general assembly
    - staked in proposals for investments: a non-member can buy ATH to stake them so that then they can propose investment opportunities to the committee
    - Explore the potential to lock ATH and provide yield / liquidity.


* Governance templates for fungible tokens? Aragon or colony?
